## About Me

Hi! I'm now a research assistant supervised by Prof. <a href="https://vlislab22.github.io/vlislab/linwang.html">Lin Wang</a> at HKUST.

Currently, I am interested in Event-based vision and Multi-modal learning.

Prior to HKUST, I obtained my B. Eng. and M. Eng. major in Electronic Science and Technology and Optical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) respectively, where I focused on Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation.
